# Credit-Risk-Modelling

Project Description: Credit Risk Modeling with Machine Learning

Objective:

This project aims to develop a high-accuracy, multi-class credit risk classification model using Python's XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms. The model will leverage real-world data, including CIBIL scores (a prominent Indian credit bureau score), to predict the likelihood of loan default with four categories:

P1: Low risk (highly likely to repay)
P2: Medium-low risk
P3: Medium-high risk
P4: High risk (most likely to default)
Methodology:

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:

Obtain real-world credit risk data, ensuring ethical considerations and data privacy regulations are met.
Perform thorough data cleaning:
Handle missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).
Address outliers (e.g., capping, winsorization).
Encode categorical features (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
Normalize or standardize numerical features for consistent scaling.
Explore and visualize the data:
Analyze distributions, relationships, and potential biases.
Use techniques like correlation matrices, histograms, and scatter plots.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features that might enhance model performance:
Calculate financial ratios, delinquency indicators, and loan-to-income ratios.
Derive categorical features from income brackets or employment sectors.
Perform feature selection techniques (e.g., LASSO regression) to identify the most informative features.
Model Development and Training:

Divide the preprocessed data into training, validation, and testing sets.
Implement XGBoost and Random Forest models:
Leverage the strengths of XGBoost for its gradient boosting approach, regularization techniques, and handling of missing values.
Use Random Forest for its decision tree ensemble, robustness to noise, and feature importance insights.
Tune hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, or Bayesian optimization to find the optimal configuration for each model.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of both models on the validation set using multi-class classification metrics:
Accuracy (overall percentage of correct predictions)
Precision (proportion of true positives among predicted positives for each class)
Recall (proportion of true positives identified for each class)
F1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall)
Confusion matrix (visualization of actual vs. predicted labels)
Compare the performance of XGBoost and Random Forest.
Model Selection and Deployment:

Choose the model with the best performance on the validation set, considering the trade-off between accuracy and other metrics relevant to credit risk assessment (e.g., minimizing Type I and Type II errors).
Consider deploying the chosen model as a web application, API, or integrated into a credit risk assessment system.
Benefits:

Improved credit risk assessment: Precisely categorize loan applicants based on default risk, leading to more informed lending decisions.
Enhanced profitability: Reduce defaults and loan losses, ultimately increasing financial returns for lenders.
Fairer lending practices: Leverage objective data-driven models to minimize human bias and promote responsible lending.
Scalability and automation: Easily scale the model to handle large datasets and automate decision-making.
Future Enhancements:

Explore deep learning architectures (e.g., convolutional neural networks) for potential further performance gains.
Integrate model explainability techniques (e.g., LIME, SHAP) to gain deeper understanding of model predictions.
Regularly monitor and retrain the model with new data to ensure its continued effectiveness.
Incorporate macroeconomic factors or external data sources for even more comprehensive risk assessment.
This comprehensive description lays out a well-structured credit risk modeling project using Python machine learning, emphasizing real-world data, multi-class classification, and hyperparameter tuning for high accuracy. It highlights the benefits and outlines potential future enhancements for continued improvement.
